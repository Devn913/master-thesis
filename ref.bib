abstract={Class labels in multi-label datasets are only associated with a very small fraction of the data instances leading to a class imbalance problem. There exist multi-label learning algorithms that handle the datasets' class imbalance issue by assigning favorable weights for positive labels to compensate for their scarce occurrence. The weight assignment assumes full label information and doesn't provision for the uncertainty introduced by unobserved or missing labels. Therefore, to deal with the class imbalance problem in multi-label learning with missing labels, we propose Class Imbalance aware Missing labels Multi-label Learning, CIMML. Our proposed method handles class imbalance issue by constructing a label weight matrix with weight estimation guided by how frequently a label is present, absent, and unobserved. Utilizing the class imbalance sensitive weights and auxiliary label correlations, we introduce a weighted squared loss function with discriminatory label weights which guides the missing label completion and learns the multi-label classifier efficiently. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of proposed classifier against state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches for missing labels underlining the significance of handling label imbalance for multi-label learning for missing labels.},

abstract ={As per the estimates of the World Health Organization, aging population is increasing in developing countries and dementia is going to become epidemic among elderly in the coming decades. This demands early action to prevent the disease and treatment of the affected persons, which is poorly existent in middle- and low-income countries. The need of the hour to tackle dementia in India is to estimate disease burden in the community, search for risk and protective factors of dementia, and undertake measures to provide social benefits to the sufferers and those who are at risk. Raising awareness among the public and general physicians is an important task ahead. In India, there is lack of good longitudinal studies which can provide true trend of the disease and determine risk factors, paucity of basic and clinical researches on dementia, poor awareness, and inadequate availability of social benefit. India, being a country of diverse ethnicity and cultures, has great advantages to carry out genetic epidemiological study. The information may be useful for undertaking remedial measure. This article will highlight the existing state of the above medical and social issues and deficiencies, so that the stakeholders can make adequate preparation to provide relief to the dementia patients and those who are at risk. It is expected that the medical and scientific community will draw attention to the medical problem with the help of governmental and non-governmental agencies, and the political leadership will be motivated to undertake the issue of providing socioeconomic benefit to families of the victims.},

abstract={Transfer learning has been successfully used in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer{\^a}EUR(tm)s disease (AD). In these methods, data from one single or multiple related source domain(s) are employed to aid the learning task in the target domain. However, most of the existing methods utilize data from all source domains, ignoring the fact that unrelated source domains may degrade the learning performance. Also, previous studies assume that class labels for all subjects are reliable, without considering the ambiguity of class labels caused by slight differences between early AD patients and normal control subjects. To address these issues, we propose to transform the original binary class label of a particular subject into a multi-bit label coding vector with the aid of multiple source domains. We further develop a robust multi-label transfer feature learning (rMLTFL) model to simultaneously capture a common set of features from different domains (including the target domain and all source domains) and to identify the unrelated source domains. We evaluate our method on 406 subjects from the Alzheimer{\^a}EUR(tm)s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database with baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data. The experimental results show that the proposed rMLTFL method can effectively improve the performance of AD diagnosis, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

volume={42},

pages={527-536},
abstract={The least square twin support vector machine (LS-TSVM) obtains two 
58
 non-parallel hyperplanes by directly solving two systems of linear equations instead of two quadratic programming problems (QPPs) as in the conventional twin support vector machine (TSVM), which makes the computational speed of LS-TSVM faster than that of the TSVM. However, LS-TSVM ignores the structural information of data which may contain some vital prior domain knowledge for training a classifier. In this paper, we apply the prior structural information of data into the LS-TSVM to build a better classifier, called the structural least square twin support vector machine (S-LSTSVM). Since it incorporates the data distribution information into the model, S-LSTSVM has good generalization performance. Furthermore, S-LSTSVM costs less time by solving two systems of linear equations compared with other existing methods based on structural information. Experimental results on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that our S-LSTSVM performs well. Finally, we apply it into Alzheimer{\^a}EUR(tm)s disease diagnosis to further demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm.},
